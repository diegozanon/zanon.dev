zanon.dev is my personal website where I blog about programming topics and create simple tutorials.

The source code available here is what I use to build and deploy. You can read and copy the source, but if you want a similar website, there are better tools for it like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
