[diego.zanon.dev](https://diego.zanon.dev) is my personal website where I build simple tutorials to teach programming topics.

The source code available here is what I use to build and deploy. You can read and copy the source, but it was custom-made thinking only on my needs. If you want a similar blog, I suggest you to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
